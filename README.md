# CrossHatch

CrossHatch is a crossword construction app. Its goal is to provide a free yet capable tool that allows anyone to make puzzles they can be proud of.

It runs entirely within the browser, meaning it is cross platform and no installation is required. It also requires no backend server and runs perfectly offline.

There is no registration fee, and the source code is freely available. https://github.com/ben4808/crosshatch

## Features
- Interactive autofill based on your word list
- Fill grids one section at a time
- Heuristics based manual fill shows which words word best with the fill around them
- Easy interface for clue editing
- Save and load .puz files (though no rebus yet)
